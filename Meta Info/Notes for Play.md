# Roleplay
1. The PCs do not “miss”
2. Do not roleplay their characters. Let them describe how they do things.
3. Persuasion is not mind control
4. Multiple players rolling for the same thing doesn't make sense. There is the “help” action, which provides advantage. Unless there is a plausible reason that the first player might have missed something.
# Combat
1. Two options for crit:
	1. Standard: Roll all dice twice over, then add flat modifiers.
	2. Alternate: Calculated as max possible damage + a standard attack
2. Two options for potion:
	1. Standard: Using a potion takes an action. Roll for it if need be.
	2. Alternate: Using a potion as an action always heals the maximum amount. Using it as a bonus action, roll for it if need be.
3. If two PCs roll the same initiative, they can team up. 
4. Rolling a 1 for initiative is disadvantage on first attack. Rolling a 20 is advantage. 
# General
1. If there is a question I have no answer for, consider rolling a d20. If 1-10, “no”, if 11-20, “yes”.
2. Use all senses in descriptions. Sight, sound, touch, smell, taste, feel/vibe.
