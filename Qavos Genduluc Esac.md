The wizard of [[qu'Hajar]].

Qavos is often unpredictable. He is often not at his tower, preferring to venture about. He is law-abiding and does as he is asked by the governance of qu’Hajar. Qavos hides his true intentions. 

Qavos speaks quickly, but with great care for his words. He acts to avoid direct conflict, often with compliments and promises of reward. 

Qavos is currently working on finding a solution to the impending famine in qu’Hajar. He needs them to defeat the Golem of Vera. From it, collect its rhinestone, the [[Rhinestone of Verda]]. Twist: He created the golems, [[Fred and Charles]], and subsequently shrunk and lost them. The golem are missing somewhere inside of the walls of the wizard tower, and the party must shrink to find them.
