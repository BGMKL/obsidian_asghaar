#npc
Located in the sewers of [[qu'Hajar]].

He goes by no other name. He does not know another name. He knows only that he is the king of the rats, though more so, the mother of the rats. He resides in the sewers of quâ€™Hajar, and only desires for his own to be accepted into society, and protected under law. 

He is a dwarf, and wields thrown axes. He dons the Crown of the Rat King, which is a headpiece constructed of dulled, corrugated metal. It shines green in candlelight.
