# Session 1: 7/20/2024
Backstory regarding the meeting of our party. First, [[Galbruc Sa'arum]] and [[Laucian Elderstone]] on the road. They meet [[Treebus]] at [[k’Jar Kiil]]. Then [[Dick Morgan]] at the [[Blind Orc]] in [[Rûh]].

Galbruc promises the bereft couple that he will find their son [[Edwin]]. They search, noting the presence of the [[Feylight Festival]]. They encounter a giant weasel who speaks common inside of the shack (known as the [[Weasel Shack]]. The party splits, with Laucian and Dick traveling together, Laucian spits on a smaller, less intelligent weasel. 

Entering the [[Feywild]], the party meets together. They find Edwin, but must rescue him from a sea hag. The party is heavily damaged, but [[Barbelo]], a couatl, intervenes. He heals the party and rewards them with tickets. 

After playing games, they buy prizes. Many healing potions, a decanter of endless water, and two alchemy jugs.  They return to the Blind Orc to rest. 

**Level 2**
# Session 2: 7/25/2024
Re-decided player stats to be more balanced. 

Spoke with [[Zoremar Gunnagi]] at [[Zoremar’s Zorestuff]]. Bought some weapons. Went to the herbalist, [[Whoosh]], and bought [[Wandercaps]] and [[Moongrass]] from the merchant [[Chuncle]].

Traveled to the [[Collector's House]]. Met [[Ibkis and Candeloch]], a scared goblin. Rescued his brother, while also killing [[Pottery]] the hobgoblin and  two additional goblins.

The party located a hidden room, with a well of magical water. Treebus drank, and had visions of a city on fire. On the wall, written in Theives’ Cant, was the name “[[Sir Torpor]]”.

Walked past a room of two bugbears, one injured. After disarming a trap, encountered a large octagonal room which was stripped bare. Hidden in a chest, a [[Mysterious Note (Collector's House)]] written in a language unknown to any in the party. Laucian placed the note on a pedestal, only to see a creature trapped in a tapestry, and hear its voice. 
# Session 3: 7/31/2024
The party fights two bugbears. They see the symbol of [[Akaal]] engraved in that room. After leaving the collector’s house, tapestry in hand, however leaving the note, the party leaves toward [[qu'Hajar]]. They ask a fisherman to boat them across lake [[a’Kyr]], and find their way into the city. They meet their guide, travel somewhat, and shop a little. Interesting news of a wizard is heard. They witness the murder of a priest in daylight. A note was stabbed into Treebus, “Meet here at midnight”.
# Session 4: 8/11/2024
The party asks their guide to correlate a meeting with the [[Halkuhlodiil Sahloknir]]. They meet him in a smaller temple, not the grand one. He is a tall, white dragonborn in a hood. He contracts them to protect the memorial of that fallen priest the following day. They oblige with the promise of coin. 

They also oblige to the note. They meet a group of hooded figures, which, once they follow into a house, attack them. Once battered, the aggressors reveal it is a test; they lead downstairs and meet the leader of the [[Order of the Equinox]], a wood elf, [[Adwynn Viltuush]]. She asks them to work as double agents to contribute to their agenda against the “regime”.

Treebus met a man who speaks Sylvan in a tavern. Treebus got very drunk and attacked Galbruc.

Laucian and Dick argue about who to help and where to keep their morals. Dick argues to take the money and go; Laucian, that it is moral to help, and he aligns with the Order. 
# Session 5: 8/24/2024
Attending [[Memorial of Talthuuf]] at [[Church Raye]]. The Order of the Equinox attacks, to which the party “fought convincingly”. The O.E. captures a priest. A member of the guard suspects a double agent, and asks the party if they saw any suspicious behavior ([[Suspicious qu'Hajar Guard]]). The party meets with Adwynn in the same place as previous. Loud voices are heard from an adjacent room. Adwynn tells of the wizard and his frequency near the sewers. The party ventures there in search of the caster, and while fighting giant rats, puts the [[Rat King (Skarn Tarnveil)]] (dwarf) to sleep.
# Session 6: 12/28/2024

The party arrived at the wizard island side of the sewer. They exit, and, eventually meeting the wizard [[Qavos Genduluc Esac]], ask for his help. They show him the tapestry with the sprite contained inside. He takes it and puts it into a jar, in order to brew. He then asks them if they might aid him. He shrinks them down and directs them to find a stone golem inside the wall.

The party kills some spiders, and finds a secret passageway which leads to a mimic. Inside the mimic, they find a seemingly-magical black stone with glowing orange encryption. Proceeding in the other direction, they find an [[Ant Blacksmith]] who directs them toward the golem brothers, [[Fred and Charles]]. They speak with Charles, who is the denser of the two brothers, and who dislikes the wizard. Fred, the one they are after, is much more conversational. He also dislikes the stone, and suggests that they replace it with the black-orange stone they found. They do this, and succeed. However, Fred’s vine and stone color shift to a darker, igneous appearance. The vines decay and die, which causes the structure to collapse; they escape, and are able to get the attention of the wizard, who grows them back to size. Fred takes this as an advantage and runs away from the tower, and through the water. As reward, the wizard promises some gold, in addition to two “custom-made magic items”.
# Session 7: 1/4/2025
**Dick's words:** I think the gist of what happened was; we were on our way back from the wizard tower following the sewer lines when we found some equinox dudes. We followed them out of the sewer and wound up beating the hell out of some other dudes guarding a street. We then met up with the lady who gave us the rat king lore drop about him being the former ruler who was banished to the sewers due to insanity. I think where we left off we were planning on convincing the rat king with the help of the lady to restore him to power to end the conflict (and to use him as a puppet to do our bidding).
# Session 8: 5/18/2025
**Laucian's notes:** Convinced Alaris to come persuade the Rat King (Skarn) to return to power. Skarn agrees in exchange for mayonaise, gold, and moon grass. We wash Skarn in the bathhouse, discover infernal ("Howard" is the voice in his head) presence under his crown Alaris tells us where to find the gems where she and Skarn found the crown. We run into Qavos on the way to the church, who gives the magic items. We go to the church ruins, and find that someone else has already been here, there are footsteps and the rock door has been moved. Descending the stairs, we find a 'sun-eating-slime' and a person. Battle.  
* The party lets one Clergy member escape
