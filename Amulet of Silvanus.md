*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
A bronze circular amulet with a chain attached. The bronze is worn with time, however etchings of thorns and vines wrap around it. A faint green glow emanates from these etchings when in moonlight. This amulet may only be attuned to and used by one who worships [[Silvanus]].

*Bramblebush:* **Once per day**, the user may summon a wall of bramble up to **10'** high and **20'** wide. This wall grants **three-quarters cover** and lasts for 1 minute. 
*Silvanus' Blessing:* **Once per day**, when a creature within **10'** of you takes damage, you may use your reaction to reduce the damage by **1d6+proficiency bonus**. This protection takes the form of tree trunks growing from the ground below the creature.
